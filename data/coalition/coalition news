			"A short film plays on a monitor during a commercial break. A young Saryd walks in a forest, looking to his sides every few seconds to take in the view. Eventually he turns to see another Saryd, both surprised. As he approaches her and the two start talking, the camera pans out to a rising sun over the forest."
			"A local screen shows a stressed Saryd working at a computer late at night. The door creaks, and she looks back to find her children peeking. She puts them to sleep, and then goes to bed herself. After waking up, she finds nobody around the house. She goes outside, seeing the children, along with their father, admiring the sun rising."
			"After a government broadcast, a timelapse plays on a spaceport monitor, showcasing Ring of Friendship gaining more and more solar panels on its exterior over the centuries."

			`"Some fresh produce would you like, Captain? If purchase these, you do, teach you a family recipe I could. I'm sure that love it, a human would. Probably."`
			"After noticing you looking at the produce, the farmer asks if you would like some free samples, before grabbing an entire box with various fruits and vegetables, and handing it to you."
			"Dozens of farmers in different stands call out to you as you walk by the spaceport, asking you to take a look at the special prices of today's 'food expo.' You later look into it, and turns out yesterday there also was an expo, as well as the day before that. Tomorrow's starts the moment today's ends."
